<hr />

**a. Clone a remote git repository to your local machine.**

```bash
git clone <url>
```

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

Make some changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Changes"
```

```bash
git fetch origin
```

```bash
git rebase origin/main
```

```bash

```

```bash

```

**b. Fetch the latest changes from a remote repository and rebase your local branch on to the updated remote branch.**



**c. Write the command to merge "feature-branch" into "master" by providing a custom commit message for the merge.**
